# MoSDeF tutorials

This repository is intended to be a place to stash notebooks demonstrating 
various functions in MoSDeF, before they can be added to the main 
tutorials repository. 

Current notebooks:
- [rotate_about_bond](https://github.com/chrisiacovella/mosdef_tutorials/blob/main/rotate_about_bond.ipynb) - demonstrates how to use mbuild to rotate a molecule about a bond, useful for generating a sequence of configurations to map out the torsional landscape.
- [automated_torsion_landscape_QM](https://github.com/chrisiacovella/mosdef_tutorials/blob/main/automated_torsion_landscape_QM.ipynb)  - based on the rotate_about_bond notebook, uses mbuild to rotate about a bond, performing an nwchem QM calculation for each configuration to generate the torsional energy landscape.
